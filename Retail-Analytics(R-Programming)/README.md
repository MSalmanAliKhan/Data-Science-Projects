Retail, the process of selling goods and services directly to consumers, is a cornerstone of the global economy. Retailers play a pivotal role in connecting manufacturers and producers with end consumers, offering a wide array of products across various industries.

The objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of retail data, including weekly sales, markdowns, and various store attributes (such as store types and departments), while considering key influencing factors like CPI, temperature, fuel price, unemployment, and holidays.

This dataset comprises historical sales records for 45 stores situated in diverse regions, each of these stores featuring multiple departments. Additionally, the company conducts several promotional markdown events throughout the year, particularly preceding major holidays such as the Super Bowl, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. It is noteworthy that weekâ€™s encompassing these significant holidays carry five times the evaluation weight compared to regular non-holiday weeks.
