Twitter (X) sentiment analysis is a powerful technique in the realm of natural language processing and data analytics, focused on gauging and interpreting the emotional tone and opinions expressed within the vast expanse of tweets that populate the Xverse.

The objective of this project is to perform entity level sentiment analysis on multilingual tweets to understand trends and insights about the Tweets. A model should also be designed to categorize the sentiments of future tweets based on similar datasets.

This dataset comprises sentiment analysis at the entity level on Twitter data, classifying messages into three distinct categories: Positive, Negative, and Neutral. In this classification, messages deemed irrelevant to the entity are categorized as Irrelevant. The dataset is structured with columns such as Entity, Sentiments, and Content. Specifically, 'twitter_training.csv' serves as the training set, while 'twitter_validation.csv' functions as the testing set.
