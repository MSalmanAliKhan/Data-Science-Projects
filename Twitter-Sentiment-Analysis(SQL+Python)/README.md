Twitter (X) sentiment analysis is a powerful technique in the realm of natural language processing and data analytics, focused on gauging and interpreting the emotional tone and opinions expressed within the vast expanse of tweets that populate the Xverse.

The objective of this project is to perform entity level sentiment analysis on multilingual tweets to understand trends and insights about the Tweets. A model should also be designed to categorize the sentiments of future tweets based on similar datasets.
